# project-1-group-3 - Crimes in Toronto
This part of the project was done by Stephen Fernandes with reviews of Clarajean Lugenge and Gurpal Gill.
The project's purpose was to take the CSV file, which holds the amount of time that occurred in the city of Toronto and organize it.
The code takes the major crimes (assault, break and enters, auto theft, and others) and the locations of each crime 
To make an easy-to-understand graph showing the total crimes in each district of Toronto 
To solve the question of where is the safest place to live based on crime trends.
