# Project-1-group-3- Which District in Toronto is the best District to live in?


# The main purpose of the project is to help us and other future home buyers on what main factors to analyze in deciding on which district to live in the city of Toronto.

# We decided to focus on the key four factors which included crime rate, number of employers, real estate pricing and school ratings per each district of the City of Toronto, the ditricts being Old Toronto, East York, North York, Scarborough, York and Etobicoke. We believe that these four factors are the most important that one should consider when deciding on where to purchase a new home.

# This project gives us and potential buyers an analytically and statistically proven information on the best district to live in Torornto.

# Based on recent crime statistics (2014-2022) East York is the safest district of all the city of Toronto based on assault, auto theft, breaking and entering, homicide, robery, shootings and theft of over a value of $5,000. Additionally, the data shows as well, there was an overall increase of crime in all the districts and this was impacted by the rise in population overtime.

# After determining the average prices of homes in each district between the years 2015-2021, it can be concluded that the York district carries the most expensive homes snd Scarborough was the least expensive district to live in. However, based on the data, East York and Etobicoke presented to be the best districts to live in because both their pricing ranks in the middle in terms of average pricing over the period of time (2015-2021) as compared to the other districts. Furthermore, these two districts can potentially meet the average price threshold for an average income individual.

# Based on the number of employers per district in the city of Toronto, the data helped to come to a conclusion that there is more job opportunities in Old Toronto district as compared to other districts. This factor is essential to analyse as the amount of employers affects an individual's chances of being employed and increases the possibility of getting employment.
